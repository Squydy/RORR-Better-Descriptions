Is the imp also stranded here?\n\nThe Black Imp can move from location to location, seemingly instantly.

At this point my air filtration warning went from yellow to red, and I began to have difficulties breathing..\n\nWhile sentient, these mushrums were not very intelligent. It had what looked like three eyes, but it could not navigate very well, implying that those may be fake eyes to scare predators. It also had no mouth to eat, but would plant itself over corpses, slowly absorbing nutrients through its root-like feet.",

		"whorl.story" : "Day 8. I was awoken by an abrupt collision of something hard against my suit. A volley of sensors screamed in my ears as a hairline fracture arced across my vision. \n\nThe hard shell of a monstrous “Whorl” nearly compromised my air lock. If I hadn't had a small tube of polymer sealant from the astrotrain I would not be recording this now. \n\nThese carapaced organisms propel themselves with some form of gas-propulsion. Despite their similar appearance to the nautili of old, they do not use a bellows-like system for locomotion, but a steady streaming of gas through their curling shell. I wonder if this heavy armor prevents them from attaining higher altitudes, constrained to hover among the land creatures.",
		"clayMan.name" : "Clay Man",
		"clayMan.story" : "Quick with his sword and quicker with his feet; the agility of these clay 'people' is unexpected with a form so roughly shaped. \n\nWhen faced with one of the few creatures here which I feel some humanity in, my aloneness closes in. Why do they have clay pots on their heads? Could it be protection from this cruel reality, or maybe just to hide the scars from this brutal planet..",
		"bighornBison.name" : "Bighorn Bison",
		"bighornBison.story" : "The teleporter nearly launched me into a steaming dung heap. I could not have anticipated such an enormous beast being its source. More impressive than their rumbling bellows is the bighorn's charge. Their many tons of muscle produce a crushing slam of horn and matted hair. \n\nWhen they are not stampeding after me I have observed these monsters using their massive heads to bludgeon rocks and fight amongst themselves. How can they expend so much energy on fruitless activity? Are they merely trying to keep from freezing?",
		"mechanicalSpider.name" : "Mechanical Spider",
		"mechanicalSpider.story" : "The malware of our age! These mechanical parasites were probably lurking on the ship before the crash. Pirates will use these bugs to collect especially valuable cargo, redirect transmission signals, or even hijack ships. Spiders can be programmed with all kinds of malicious objectives. \n\nIn general they are quite difficult to find and eradicate on large vessels, but now that they're loose they seem to be able to operate outside their software. They have retained their defense capabilities, and are risky to engage. Though, I wonder, how long will they continue to run without access to an electrical grid?",

		"gup.story" : "It is quite rare that I smell anything through my respirator. I could not have been prepared for how bizarre no longer having a sense of smell is.  However, there have been a rare few occasions when I caught some trace aroma- generally somewhat bitter on this planet, but I savor them greedily. \n\nWhen I encountered this gelatinous beast I was assailed by a sweet smell! A strangely fruity scent.. Oh, how it brings me back to a more innocent time! As I struck the congealed blimp of a creature it divided and seemed to gain energy. With each blow more of the saccharine odor escaped the monster. I must admit, I may have been overzealous in my attack..",

Their powerful blows open great lashes in the quaking ground.\n\nThough my guilt almost stays my hand, I cannot let them keep me from surviving this nightmarish planet. I know it is impossible to quell their fury; so instead I must end it.",

		"evolvedLemurian.story" : "Could this be a distant cousin of the Lemurians below? An ancient evolutionary leap? These airborne reptiles do not interact with the ground Lemurians except to harass them occasionally. Perhaps there is some kind of natural feud between the species? \n\nIt is the membranous skin that attaches their long arms to their body which enables their flight. Each wingtip culminates in vicious talons. When they come in flocks these winged Lemurians are capable of great carnage.",
		"templeGuard.name" : "Temple Guard",
		"templeGuard.story" : "A robot creature that assembles itself.. I have not seen them materialize other than when I unknowingly trigger their presence. I cannot believe this is indeed a machine- and yet it is made from some alloy and uses heavy artillery! Was this on the ship, or are these guards a naturally occurring 'species' here? My suit's scanners are unable to detect any manufacturers' signature.\n\nThey seem to be determined not to let me pass. They attack with unlimited focus.",
		"elderLemurian.name" : "Elder Lemurian",
		"elderLemurian.story" : "Seems to be very large version of the Lemurians; perhaps this great lizard is a queen? With similar armor and much thicker skin, it took much more to bring down this foe. She moves much slower and posses a powerful scorching blast.\n\nI would willingly give up some of my dwindling rations to explore the Lemurian tunnels unnoticed. My mind envisions great communal caverns and many spectacular subterranean dwellings. Do great legions of Lemurians walk under my feet?",
		"archerBug.name" : "Archer Bug",
		"archerBug.story" : "Such aggravating creatures! These insects come in droves- as a group their wings create a maddening whine. Even the other creatures seem disturbed by their presence. Though they are not particularly strong, the circling insects certainly frustrate me. \n\nA small amount of their projectile spit managed to penetrate one of the layers of my suit. It was extremely caustic. A festering rash has formed in the area, but doesn't seem to be spreading.",

		"colossus.story" : "A low groaning, lasting for a few days at least. From the relative safety of my drop pod I watched as a mountain rose to its knees, pushing itself up with arms of stone and dirt and twine. \n\nThe Colossus appears as a cousin of the Rock Golem and share many similarities, from its red gaze to its stocky stature. Around its feet many smaller golems rose, joining it. In what possible ways could conventional weapons help me?\n\nI've begun to find a dark humor in the absolute overkill that I face. This is simply ridiculous.",
		"wanderingVagrant.name" : "Wandering Vagrant",
		"wanderingVagrant.story" : "Day 3. While looking through some wreckage of the old ship, I felt a hot sensation on my skin and a brilliant white flash. Over the horizon maybe 5 miles north I saw it, looming over the forest tops.\n\nIt must be the size of a house, this thing. A massive variant of the jellyfish seen earlier; this behemoth hovers in the air, searching for something. The gas used to propel this beast bend the trees below it flat. When it spotted its prey, it sent out six bioluminescent orbs, all crashing towards the ground and incinerating the target. \n\nThis Vagrant, as I've come to call it, seems to wander amidst the skies, followed by many jellyfish. On the occasion the clouds part, I swear I sometimes see hundreds of vagrants up there. What are they looking for?",

This seemed to disturb something deep and violent below the ground..\n\nThe Magma Worm exploded out of the ground, knocking me off my feet. While I struggled with shell shock, I saw it arc through the sky, then plunge back into the ground with another bang. \n\nReaching about.. 200 meters, the worm moves extremely fast for its size. Permanently burning out of pores in its skin, the Magma Worm uses this flame as both a hunting tool and a way to melt through the ground quickly. Its small, beady eyes lurch around, looking for prey. With its massive size, the Magma Worm must either eat VAST amounts of food a day or hibernate for a very, very, very long time below ground.",
		"ancientWisp.name" : "Ancient Wisp",
		"ancientWisp.story" : "Could this be the architect of the smaller wisps? Perhaps this Ancient Wisp is the puppeteer behind the fiery masks harassing me thus far, or is he also a devilish device of something greater..?\n\nThe heat coming off the purple flames is extreme. Ferocious columns of lightning threaten to short-out my suit, or worse, turn me into a blistered husk. What fuels these violent, burning apparitions?",
		"impOverlord.name" : "Imp Overlord",
		"impOverlord.story" : "Oh, why me? My heart stopped when this great Imp manifested in previously empty space. So many horrendous eyes. With a gaping scream the Imp lets out a deadly red vapor. Some type of laser also trails me. \n\nThis demon is just as baffling in its movements as the smaller one. Barely escaping the Imp's whipping grasp I landed a final blow. Its dying body split open at its meridian, displaying its innards like some ghastly flower. This monster is just as gruesome in death as it was in life.",
		"ifrit.name" : "Ifrit",
		"ifrit.story" : "Could this be..? Tales I never believed recounted a horrible beast, fire incarnate. Scourge of another solar system, the Ifrit nearly wiped out an entire space colony before being chained and launched into the great black void. Supposedly the flaming jets that accompanied his roars could be seen for days as he drifted outwards. \n\nGreat towers, what must have been the containment structure used to trap this monster, prevent his escape even on this forsaken plane. The only explanation I have for my surviving this legendary encounter is his many years drifting in space and having been fettered in this unforgiving, frozen wasteland.",
		"toxicBeast.name" : "Toxic Beast",
		"toxicBeast.story" : "This goliath's body has been carved by this world, covered in numerous scars. The squealing queen had seen many battles. Her coarse hair growing in jagged patches between each old wound only increased her fearsome appearance. \n\nHot breath from the boar's massive nose fogged up my helmet so badly that it was a marvel I was able to evade her stomping hooves overhead.",
		"cremator.name" : "Cremator",
		"cremator.story" : "I could not believe my eyes as this creature erupted from the lava. My suit's temperature gauges screeched in warning. How can anything subsist in such heat? The lava parts in waves as the monster swims rapidly through it. \n\nThrough craters in the Cremator's thick back armor red hot boulders explode in every direction. The amount of heat and pressure within its body must be a source of immense power. However, its head does not appear as well protected. I pray that it is a source of weakness, for if this leviathan bests me I know there will be no remains left to mark my short existence.",
		"scavenger.name" : "Scavenger",
		"scavenger.story" : "Who knew a pack rat could be so dangerous! This creature seems to be hoarding many of the items littered across this planet. I have seen no others of its kind. If it hadn't been so intent on slaying me I would have tried to gain this Scavenger as an ally.. \n\nWill I ever see a friendly face again, or will my last breaths be on this hostile planet?",
		"providence.name" : "Providence",
		"providence.story" : "I recognized him from the security footage... he was the one who blew the cargo hatches open. He was the one who killed everyone. \n\nProvidence, as I came to call him, moved faster and with more purpose than anything else I've seen on this planet. He must command great power, for he seemed to easily control two great gilded wurms of a species similar to the Magma Worm. Is he able to command everyone on this planet? I don't know his purpose, or his reasoning, but he did not give me a choice. I had to kill him... so why do I feel like I made a terrible mistake?\n\n...Why did we have a teleporter from this planet in our cargo hold?",
		"bramble.name" : "Bramble",
		"bramble.story" : "While walking through overgrown ruins I found myself surrounded by strange rustling that I could not place.  Stepping into a massive temple, vines whipped the entryway shut and the ivy began slithering down the walls.  These living Brambles spit caustic venom and I'm thankful to only have holes left in my gloves. Their hypnotic sway distills fear in me and I recognize some higher intelligence in their movements.  The bark at their base facilitates some kind of locomotion, though I can't identify any apparent muscular system inside that would drive it. After the encounter, the resulting coughs and spasms left me on edge as I scaled the tower and left the echoes behind me.",
		"lemurianCavalry.name" : "Lemurian Cavalry",
		"lemurianCavalry.story" : "I found a group of red Lemurians resting in the dilapidated ruins with domesticated boars alongside them.  I've never seen a red species outside of the flying types, though I doubt these are any more welcoming.  With great spears and flamboyant helmets, they resemble cavalry of times past, and I'm not equipped to face any chariots head-on. In the distance I can see two of them sparring atop their beasts. They attack with sharp agility and acrobatic prowess that I hope to never experience.",
		"macrobe.name" : "Macrobe",
		"macrobe.story" : "Sinking into an endless lake, I was caught off-guard by these huge cellular beasts.  Bounding towards me, I can almost identify their internal anatomy behind thick membranes - How is it possible that some sort of microbe could get this large?  Can this really be a single cell? Rough, thorn-like cilia coat its surface and it's flagellum serves as a razor sharp whip. The water doesn't seem to impede it at all, though its strange bouncing behavior may be a result of its attempts to pursue me under heavy water pressure. I'm weary of the force it seems to exert even within these conditions. My oxygen supply can't afford any leaks.",
		"macrobicPredator.name" : "Macrobic Predator",
		"macrobicPredator.story" : "Some kind of massive insect, this creature snaps like a viper and skitters like an ant.  It shouldn't be possible at such a scale to move so abruptly and yet it does.  Similar to the Macrobe, this monster is some kind of predatory cell. With a massive rope of nerves at its core, I can only imagine it acts on instinct alone.  I dug into a corpse to see if the spinal rope could sustain me in this toxic hive, but I found my arms stuck to the thick membrane and I had to use my knife to remove the non-newtonian gel. It'd make a great trap for prey, but I don't have time to test that theory.",
		"lynxTribe.name" : "Lynx Tribe",
		"lynxTribe.story" : "I glanced to one side, trying to get my bearings. By sheer luck, my eyes picked up something barely visible, so still it could be mistaken for a rock. A shiver ran down my spine as I realized it was alive. I hadn't heard anything approach; how long had it been watching me? Why hadn't it attacked me? I suppose the creature had never seen anything like me. As we exchanged gazes, I noticed there were more of them. Gripped by fear, I shot a glance at my firearm which, in my hubris, was still in its holster. A twig snapped, and I immediately looked back to them, but they were gone. I walk slowly now. There could be one of these behind every blade of grass.",
		"lynxTotem.name" : "Lynx Totem",
		"lynxTotem.story" : "Travelling through the fungal caverns, I kept seeing out of place rubble that trailed to nowhere.  With no buildings in sight, I was shocked to see a brick wall in the distance.  Little cat-like creatures with masks and weaponry danced around the structure, and I could hear them laugh with one another.  They appeared to be practicing some kind of worship, though the structure looked unlike anything I've seen on this planet.  More of them crawled out from the dirt nearby, but strangely I haven't seen any evidence of them resting or hiding in the soil prior to that.  Luckily they were distracted - I don't know that I could take on a horde of that size, no matter how small they were.",
		"swift.name" : "Swift",
		"swift.story" : "These flying stones manage to stay airborne despite their shale armor.  Like a thousand darts thrown from the sun, they dive so swiftly toward me that their beaks slam into the ground.  I've yet to see a surface that they cannot puncture, and I'm shocked that their beaks never seem worn. Their predictive aim is troubling, and they seem to know where I'm headed before I do. I've witnessed packs of these strange birds circling like vultures in the distant sky, though I've never witnessed any of them scavenging for food. Attempts to fashion their armor into new blades have resulted in nothing but chips in my knife.",
		"trokk.name" : "Trokk",
		"trokk.story" : "While resting in the shade of a massive tree, I was startled at what I thought was an earthquake.  The ground shifted beneath my feet and I was suddenly thrown into the air.  Beneath me was the gaping maw of a Trokk, and if I weren't already gripping my pistol it would've crushed me into sheet metal.  Beyond the stone exterior of this strange walking log is some kind of vulnerable flesh like the inside of an alligator's mouth.  With no space for a stomach I shudder at the thought of what happens to its victims.",
		"tuber.name" : "Tuber",
		"tuber.story" : "The Tuber is reminiscent of the small plants I cared for back on the ship.  Nestling themselves deep in the ground, they hide from prey and wait for vibrations to initiate their fanged attack.  Like fighting a giant antlion, sometimes the best strategy was to lure them out by tossing spent magazines. I tried stones and other bait, but their responses to the bait seemed dependant on some unseen quality.  The behavior of the beasts on the planet continue to concern me - I feel like all eyes are on me despite how natural these animals seem from a distance."

There are foreign species patrolling the grasslands and bizarre housing foundations erected along worn footpaths. I've seen lizards who walk like men and otherworldly stone creatures infused by blazing lights.  They seem docile and intelligent, passing by one another with little interaction, but their stiffened postures leave me wary. There's so much culture here for an undocumented planet. There's so much history to these buildings, but their construction doesn't make any sense. Rebar and concrete make up juvenile fabrications, accompanied by worn bricks gathered from ancient castles just meters away.  Tree stumps and dead branches litter the landscape as if a forest was felled. But decay settled on this garden long ago... How do you get to concrete before raising a single village?

I would think these catwalks were built to protect from the hot sand below, but these wrecked ships are buried in such shallow dunes. When was there water here? Rain hits my helmet and sizzles at my feet. The overcast sky softens the shadows of petrified barnacles cast over the distant wooden structures. They're held together like old junk in a garage.

The bioluminescence is fighting with the pitch black of the caverns, and I can barely make out cliffs and valleys alongside these enormous mushrooms. Some younger ones toddle around and release dense gas clouds, but I've yet to see any individuals who have grown beyond my height. I'm cautious to touch the stalks of any of these towering masses should I find one, so I'm left creeping through the dark bellows towards the next pronged portal.

Stone statues of hooded figures had surrounded me silently while I slept. No drag marks, no footsteps, no sound. Except there was a sound - a faint hum resonating between them.

I can make out figures riding ships - it's hard to tell and I imagine any species that would build a tomb this deep underwater wouldn't require them. The sarcophagi lining the halls ring hollow and the tables and pots look untouched like some sort of nuclear shelter, frozen in time. The ceilings in here are so high and have skylights dug out from the earth above.

I've caught glimpses of the tribes ferrying back and forth atop their ashen shells almost as frequently as I've seen sacrifices made to feed them.

It's either waiting for these orange beasts to leave or upsetting the hive with more gunfire. At least this time I'm smelling strawberries instead of rot, but the sweet siren's call isn't doing much when I can see skeletons inside this thing. I can feel a slight crawling sensation around my hands and the heat  pulses from these fibers like some kind of sick womb. I heard what sounded like crying a moment ago, but it's stopped since then.
